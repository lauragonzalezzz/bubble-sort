SORTING ALGORITHMS

1. Bubble Sort

  i. ELI5 Explanation:

    You can use a bubble sorting algorithm to find out who is tallest in your class!
    First, have everyone line up together in a straight line.
    Next, pick a volunteer--they will be the one who everyone is compared to.
    The volunteer will walk down the line of your classmates where each person will either go into a separate 'taller' line on the right or a separate 'shorter' line on the left, depending if they are taller or shorter than the volunteer. The volunteer will stay in the middle between the 'taller' and 'shorter' lines but will not be part of the line again until the end.
    Now, repeat the process so each line has it's own volunteer and compare the rest of your classmates in that line.
    Keep separating the lines and picking volunteers until each line only has one person.
    Next, everybody goes back into one big line, starting from the left line, then the volunteer, then the right line until everyone is back in line!
